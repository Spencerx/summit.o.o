<p>The Free/Libre Software and Open Source (FLOSS) movement has conquered the datacenters, replacing proprietary systems everywhere. The mission of building a wholly free operating system for servers and desktops is accomplished. Meanwhile, we're in the middle of a radical change of how we think of computing. Cloud computing (and mobile) are radically new things where the FLOSS movement still needs to find good paradigms to protect and promote freedom for the digital citizens. And for the first time ever, Open Source implementations are leading the way: we're not imitating a fully laid out Unix or the standard C libraries. Open Source is where the new things happen regarding cloud computing and mobile. We'll be looking at lessons learned during +25 years of Open Source and how those are applied to OpenStack to create the dream of an Open Cloud operating system and at the challenges ahead.</p>
