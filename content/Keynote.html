<h3> <i>KEYNOTE - Sierra Ballroom, Saturday, 9:00-9:45.</i></h3>
</ br>
<p>Please welcome Mr. Georg C.F. Greve, CEO of Kolab Systems AG and founding Member of Free Software Foundation Europe, as he takes you on a tour of open source from its infancy to its present state of maturity and where we go from here. This keynote starts at 9:15 a.m. Saturday, September 22 in the Sierra Ballroom.</p>

<blockquote><i>"In his keynote, Georg Greve will shed some light on the path open source took, the choices we made, and the situation we're now facing in the growth of our community. Free Software has gone from infancy to adolescence, and is now on the verge of becoming an actual grown up. Simultaneously, we are now beyond the peak of the Gartner hype cycle. This brings lessons, often healthy, sometimes painful. And like all young adults we seem to already have lost some of the idealism with which we started. That is not to say we're not in a healthy state as a community, or that we aren't growing and having fun doing so. Because we are. But perhaps some idealism is worth re-discovering."</i></blockquote>
