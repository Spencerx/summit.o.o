<p>Far too often I hear engineers, enthusiasts and common users lament how troublesome RPM packaging is.  My personal mission is to lighten the burden of all who find themselves beset by packaging woes.</p>
</ br>
<p>Packaging RPMs should not be intimidating.  And this workshop will help you throw off the shackles of bondage.  Liberate your software, set it free.</p>
</ br>
<p>All the fundamentals, tricks, conventions, and wizardry of RPM packaging, so that your software can do what it's intended to do.</p>
