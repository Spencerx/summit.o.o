<p>What makes openSUSE stand out as a distribution? Why it's YaST, of course! The one-stop shop for setting up and keeping your system going. New users may be slightly intimidated by the power YaST gives them, but this quick outline of YaST modules will give them the confidence to update software, understand partitioning, start services, and troubleshoot issues.</p>
