<p>openSUSE is getting it's own ARM distribution these days. The talk will show on which devices it is usable and how you will be able to install it.</p>
</ br>
<p>Furthermore we will show how we develop it. And how everybody can make their own spin for their needs, even without any arm device.</p>
