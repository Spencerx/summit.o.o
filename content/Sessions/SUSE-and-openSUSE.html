<h1>SUSE.com and openSUSE.org - working together to release SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE</h1>
</ br>
<h2>JAEGER, Andreas - SUSE</h2>
<h3> <i>PRESENTATION - Bonaire 5, Sunday, 11:15 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.</i></h3>
</ br>
<p>The openSUSE distribution is the upstream distribution of SUSE Linux Enterprise.  This talk will explain the relationship between these two and how SUSE is trying to get features into openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Also, I'll talk about items that will be done by SUSE engineers and might end in the next version of openSUSE (if the upstream accepts the contribution).</p>
