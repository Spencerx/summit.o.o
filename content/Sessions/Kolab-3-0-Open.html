<p>Besides Office and Browser, Groupware is one of the three critical productivity applications for professional users. While there have been very strong offerings for Office and Browser, Groupware has always been lagging behind. The choice is essentially between a set of neo-proprietary Outlook focussed server centric solutions without a strong offering on the desktop that would open the door to the Linux desktop. The talk will show how Kolab is different and how its 3.0 major release is the solution that so many have been waiting for to accompany LibreOffice and Firefox.</p>
