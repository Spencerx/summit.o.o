<p>Ever since the conception of graphical environments for the computer, designers have had to make specific decisions about the way we interact with elements on a screen. However, to say that "designers" made all the decisions on how we interact with the computer is somewhat far fetched.</p>
</ br>
<p>There are many other factors that make up our computer interactions. In a sense, the word "designers" also involves people who are not directly related to the graphical world. Those could be - a sales manager who also decides what elements we see on the computer screen; a contracted hardware company that would like you to have a certain software on by default; and many others may also have a part in the user interface designing process. The computer GUI has a varied influence in its identity.</p>
</ br>
<p>The multi-influence, or “multi-graphical input” for devicces’ GUI has come under particular focus in recent years. Mass adoption of mobile devices has spread the graphical competition to all new heights. It has become much harder for companies and their products to stand out on the current market, or to make a difference. Differentiation is the call for each of them. Making their devices different graphically has called for stronger branding, and each of the market players now steeres in different direction. The objective being - attracting new client and retaining the existing ones. The drive for graphical differentiation makes it clear that stringer branding will help them sing a different song.
This changes have also made it into many of our Linux environments. KDE, for example, decided to make a radical jump with KDE 4. While recently Gnome released their 3rd series other environments, prefer to keep the same idea of what a GUI should look like.</p> 
</ br>
<p>Currently Linux, as a worldwide community, faces strong fragmentation. Not all of us use KDE, or Gnome, or a graphical interface at all. At the end of the day these communities are the ones creating new software, new widgets, and new graphics. Eventually these fragmentation or macro-collaboration environment is unable to achieve "collective individuality." This means that because of the different influences that happen in a Linux environment, collectively we cannot achieve a strong branding and differentiation. We cannot stand out because all of us want to stand out. Our software or contributions speak the language and mind of its creator, except in a Linux environment, anyone can be a creator.</p>
</ br>
<p>These changes raise a question from our own group of contributors. Is openSUSE at the height of this weave of stylistic changes? This question is not about code or software integration, but exclusively about the end user experience. Reasoning carefully, the answer would be "partially." openSUSE has not taken full advantage of the branding capabilities provided by both KDE 4 and Gnome 3. This trend is more so surprising considering that openSUSE is the first to integrate and use many new Linux technologies through its unique OBS service, yet brand-wise we remain stagnant. Early adoption and fast integration in our distribution makes it harder to work on and maintain distribution specific styling.</p>
