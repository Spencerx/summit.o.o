<h3> <i>PRESENTATION - Bonaire 7, Saturday, 1:15 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.</i></h3>

<p>In this presentation we will review the current state of the OrangeFS Open Source distributed parallel file system, its architecture and what is coming on the short term horizon. We will then proceed into a discussion on the foundational architecture of OrangeFS-next and the major changes coming, including topics such as resilience, distributed file handles, policy based object location, distributed background frameworks and arbitrary attribute distributed indexes. We will conclude with a brief overview of PXFS and Parallex research underway.</p>
