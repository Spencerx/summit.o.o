<p>Many activities are required when migrating a large suite of packages from one distribution to another.  We  discuss several utilities that were developed to assist in performing these activities while migrating a large integrated suite of packages, which comprise Bull's HPC offering,  from Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server® (SLES). These utilities range from small ones that ease small tasks that are repeated many times a day to a large one that reduced a man-month task to a few hour automated run.</p>
