<p>Providing quality file serving, email, groupware etc. services to charities encounters the problem of "only at very low cost, including upkeep and backups".</p>
</ br>
<p>My small company, Ingotec, is proceeding along two pathways. One is OpenSUSE with email, eGroupWare suite, etc using only local drives and backed up by manually swapping between a pair of servers. The second pathway adds GroupWise with its database, for which we have had to go to SLES 11 SP2 with its HA facilities to make a two node cluster with only local drives, again with all the POSIX apps. HA was a challenge and worth the benefits. The problem is what can be done at very low cost indeed yet provide modern quality dependable service.</p>

<p>This talk describes the design processes, the what, why and how, and what we can achieve with open source.</p>
