<p>Think about what you had for dinner last night. Perhaps you were tired, and decided to trade off high-quality and healthy for something quick and cheap. In that case, you probably grabbed some fast food on the way home. On the other hand, someone on a first date would probably be far less concerned with the time, cost and effort a meal would take, if it meant getting to a level of excellence that was sure to impress. Though the occasional project manager may be aware of the “triple constraints” all projects actually boil down to four factors: cost, scope, schedule and – the hidden factor – quality. Ignore the four corners and you can be assured that customers will, knowingly or not, drain the profit from any project. The presentation will review all four of every project’s “triple constraints” and discuss how to avoid project troubles simply by being mindful of them.</p>

<p>Session Objectives and Participant Benefits: At the conclusion of this presentation, participants will have an awareness of how merely keeping track of the “the four corners” can avoid significant project woes.</p>
