<h2> TAN, James - SUSE</h2>
<h3> <i>Presentation - Bonaire 6, Friday, 3:00 p.m. to 3:45 p.m.</i></h3>
</ br>
<p>In this talk, James will introduce SUSE Studio Online (http://susestudio.com), a fast and easy way to create your own customized SUSE Linux distribution and software stacks.</p>
</ br>
<p>Best of all, it's completely free to use with no data lock-in. Studio supports ten different build formats for deployment to physical (disk image, ISO, PXE), virtual (Xen, VMWare, KVM, VirtualBox, OVF, Hyper-V), and cloud environments (EC2, Azure, OpenStack). The talk will focus on the cloud environments, specifically with a demo of building Puppet managed appliances in Studio and launching them in Amazon EC2.</p>
</ br>
<p>James will also provide a sneak peak of some of the new features that the development team is working on.</p>
