<p>It can be a challenge to manage your data across all of your devices and many of today's traditional solutions require you to give up your privacy to a company. In these situations you don't have direct control over your data and it is hosted on a server far away. The goal of ownCloud is to enable users to have their own private cloud hosted on their personal hardware.</p>
</ br>
<p>I'll be explaining what ownCloud is and how you can use ownCloud in your daily lives. I'll also be discussing the creation of ownCloud Inc, the company behind the ownCloud project, and what this means for businesses, users, and the future of the project. This talk will also show a preview of the new features users can expect in the next release of ownCloud.</p>
