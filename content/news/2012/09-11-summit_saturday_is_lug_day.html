<p>Apparently, there's quite a few Linux User Groups in the Central Florida region.  
  Two in just Orlando, even!  And it seems to have been a while since all these LUGs have found 
  an excuse to gather together in one place.</p>
<p>Well, the excuse is here and openSUSE Summit jumps in.  As many of you know, the openSUSE Project 
  has a long-standing tradition of supporting local groups where we visit.   Working together with some key LUG leaders in the region, we're happy to announce that Saturday is LUG Day!  We're dedicating Bonaire Room 4 to LUG Day where old friends reunite and discuss the current state of affairs in the region.  They'll be setting up tables to demonstrate their computers and offer up a few presentations throughout the day.</p>
<p>And at the end of the afternoon, LUG-ites will gather together for one big Reunion Meeting.  And to make this even more exciting, the openSUSE Summit has a special plan in the works to help raise money to support the Orlando LUGs.</p>
<p>So if you're from the area, and you haven't seen your friends in such a long time, this is your perfect opportunity.
