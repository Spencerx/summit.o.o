<h2>GNOME User Observation Hackfest lands in Orlando!</h2>
<p><i>17 September 2012</i></p>
<p><img src="/images/gnome-logo.png" alt="The GNOME Logo" align="left" />What do you get when you have a 
  city with a large installation of open source servers and desktops, a group of dedicated hackers,
  and an awesome conference?  Why, you get the GNOME User Observation Hackfest!</p>
<p>Florida's City of Largo is just crazy in love with open source.  They've got over 800 servers and thin clients using openSUSE and GNOME desktops.  And you can learn more about them when Largo's Dave Richards presents <i>Large Deployments of openSUSE</i> this Saturday afternoon.<p>
<p>GNOME Foundation is sending a group of hackers to Orlando.  They land on Thursday and begin their assault on Largo (just two hours drive away) on Friday.  There, the hackers will get first hand observations of people using GNOME in real-world situations.  Then they head back to Orlando Friday night and get busy, in the Hackroom, provided by the Summit.</p>
<p>This gives a very unique opportunity for attendees of the openSUSE Summit.  The Hackroom won't be a closed-door event.  These hackers want to hear from you.  Yes, it is true!  You have this awesome chance to meet the people who contribute to one of the world's leading open source desktop environments and and tell them your thoughts face-to-face!  You can actually make a difference by giving these folks valuable insight into just how you use GNOME and how you want to see it get even better.</p>
<p>And this all happens right here at the openSUSE Summit this <b>WEEKEND</b>!  It isn't too late to register for this completely free event.</p>
