<h2>Summit Exclusive: Go Home A Guru!</h2>
<p><i>6 September, 2012</i></p>
<img src="/images/OBS-Mug_final.png" alt="I'm an Open Build Service Guru coffee mug with OBS logo" align="left" />


<p> Imagine attending the openSUSE Summit, meeting fellow Geekos, making new friends, going to sessions, 
  learning all you can, partying the night away and then going home boasting that you're a bona-fide guru.  
  Not only possible, it could really happen! </p>
<p>For the first time ever, the Open Build Service team is going to give you the chance to do just that.  
  This limited-edition coffee mug can only be earned, not grabbed.  Here's how it works:</p>
<p>Join Craig Gardner's <i>"Packaging Made Ridiculously Easy"</i> workshop on Friday, 
  September 21 at 2:00 p.m.  Then join Adrian Schroeter's <i>"How To Work in Open Build Service"</i> 
  workshop on Saturday, September 22 at 10:00 a.m.  Complete both workshops, and you've got yourself this cool
  <i>I'm An OBS Guru</i> mug.<p>
<p><b>NO ONE</b> but those deemed worthy of this distinction gets one of these babies.  
  Only those who complete the workshops or demonstrate proven expertise earns a mug.  
  You won't find this on store shelves nor as booth swag giveaway anywhere.</p>
<p>Be the envy of all your co-workers, and even your boss, when you swagger in Monday morning with 
  coffee in hand...a certifiable guru!</p>
