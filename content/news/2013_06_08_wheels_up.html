    <h1>Wheels up for the openSUSE Summit</h1>

<p>Summer is approaching and we only have a few short month to get our ducks in a row to have another great openSUSE event. In 2012 we had our first openSUSE Summit and it was a great success. For 2013 we are expecting to repeat this success, albeit being a bit slower in getting the wheels off the ground. Nevertheless the organizational plane has taken off now and we'll need to make certain it stays in the air does not loose momentum.</p>

<p>The openSUSE Summit will take place at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Lake Buena Vista is located just outside of Orlando Florida and if you are joining us for the openSUSE Summit you want to fly into Orlando, Florida. As in 2012 the openSUSE Summit follows on the heels of <a href="http://www.susecon.com/">SUSECon</a>, thus the openSUSE Summit will take place from Friday November 15 to Sunday November 17, 2013.</p>

<p>We will be using <a href="https://github.com/mbarringer/osem">OSEM</a> (Open Source Event Manager) for our paper submission process. OSEM was started as a project when we were looking for an event manager for <a href="https://conference.opensuse.org/">oSC13</a> (openSUSE Conference 2013), and it is an openSUSE project. If you are interested in helping to further develop the tool check out the code. Expect a Call for Participation (CfP) in the next week or so. The goal is to open CfP ASAP and have the submission period open to about mid August, exact dates will be announced when CfP opens. The program should be set sometime in early October.</p>

<p>We need volunteers, yes, volunteers are always welcome. There is much to do ahead of time and then there will be more stuff to do during the event. Therefore, if you can volunteer your time and energy you are welcome. Locally during the event the registration desk will need to be occupied for example. Ahead of time, this site could use some translation, last year we had a translation into Spanish, but other language are welcome as well of course. There are a plethora of tasks that need doing. If you are interested in helping please subscribe to the opensuse-summit mailing list (opensuse-summit+subscribe at opensuse do org)</p>
