<br />
<p>Geekos are a hard-working, fun-loving bunch.  But even Geekos need a break to socialize and get some food in their bellies.  That's why we bring you the Geeko Lounge.  A place to relax, put your feet up and hang out with fellow Geekos.</p>
<br />
<p>The Geeko Lounge will remain open throughout the weekend.  Each morning, beginning at 8:00 a.m., a Continental Breakfast will be served.  Throughout the day, we'll have refreshments to quench your thirst and nibble on.  Couches and bean bags to plop your dupa on as you take a breather from the hustle and bustle of the busy day checking out sessions.</p>
<br />
<p>And, its also a place to meet our sponsors and other vendors.  You'll meet folks from Omnibond, ownCloud, openSUSE Forums, local LUG groups, and many more.  It's also the place where you can grab a bunch of materials like brochures and DVDs to take home and promote openSUSE in your neighborhood.</p>
