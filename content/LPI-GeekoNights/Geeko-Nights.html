<h2 align="center"><i>ownCloud Geeko Games Poolside Dinner</i></h2>

<p>The social event of the year begins at the Caribe Royale Hotel poolside brought to you by ownCloud, Your Cloud, Your Data, Your Way!  It's our first night together and a great way to get to know your fellow Geekos from all over the world.</p>
</ br>
<p>This poolside dinner party also brings to you an exclusive concert by openSUSE's very own Luis Nieto, Honduras's nationally-renowned musician and former director of the Honduras National Band.  Prepare yourself for the soothing sounds of a saxophonist beloved by many in his country.</p>
</ br>
<p>Then get ready to turn the night upside down as a frenzied pace ensues to build, decorate and race our boats across the pool.  Boat kits will be provided and there's prizes for everyone.  Better pack your swimsuit, because with a contest like this, you never know what is going to happen!</p>

<h2 align="center"><i>Omnibond Geeko Luau Jam</i></h2>

<p>Don that Hawaiian shirt no one lets you wear, step under the tent and you'll instantly say "Geeko, I don't think we're in Florida anymore."  Join Omnibond, makers of OrangeFS, as we take you halfway around the world to the South Seas for an experience that only Geekos could love.</p>
</ br>
<p>The fun begins at 7:00 p.m. in a tent behind the Caribe Royale Hotel and the warm waters of a lake nearby.  Satisfy your appetite with a delicious luau and toast your last night together with fellow Geekos before heading home on Sunday.</p>
</ br>
<p>Once the plates are cleared, it doesn't stop there.  Sit back and relax as the (name of act) Polynesian dancers dazzle you with moves and music.  You won't want to miss the Fire Knife act.  (More information needed.)</p>
</ br>
<p> Then get ready to blow the tarp off our tent as we kick off the Geeko Jam Session!  That's right.  For all you Geekos out there, pack up your favorite musical instrument before you come to the Summit.  The floor is everyone's as Geekos musicians jam together and the rest of us dance the night away.  Who knows, maybe we'll finally create that Geeko Anthem we've always wanted.</p>
