      <p><b><u>The Four Tracks</u></b></p>
      <p>This is the first openSUSE Asia Summit. The theme is:</p>
      <p class="text-center xxl"><b>openSUSE - Bring you to the free world!</b></p>
      <ul>
          <li>End User Track
              <p>The end user track provides the opportunity for the power users of any application to share their knowledge and share tricks they apply to get the most out of the applications they use. Know of a non-obvious but very useful feature, present it's usage to fellow Geekos and users in this track. Topics include, but not limited to, applications, desktop environments, multimedia solutions and games.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Business Track
              <p>The business track provides the opportunity for those that use openSUSE and/or FOSS in their business to describe the unique challenges they face. This includes, but not limited to, issues and solutions of interfacing with regulatory institutions, other business, staff training, and changing technology course.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Community & Project Track
              <p>Sessions in this area should focus on project and community activities, including, but not limited to, project governance, marketing, artwork and advocate reports. In many cases, this sessions bring a strong sense of unity to the project as a whole as we discuss some of the unique challenges that an Open Source Community confronts. If you have ideas that can help a community be stronger, join this track.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Technology & Development Track
              <p>Sessions in this area should focus on system technology and distribution development. Including, but not limited to, software packaging, development/testing/debugging tools/practices/methods. Infrastructure software, deployment strategies and monitoring. These sessions will help a few of our members gain understanding of the many tools they can use when working in development for the distribution and other exciting projects.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b><u>The Events</u></b></p>
      <p>We will have four types of events:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Lightning Talk (10 mins)</li>
         <li>Short Talk (30 mins)</li>
         <li>Long Talk (60 mins)</li>
         <li>Workshop (2 hours)</li>
      </ul><br />

      <p>If it is possible that your audience can practise what you share in a meeting room, you would better do a workshop.</p>
