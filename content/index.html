      <h2 class="title-center">Introduction</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/" target="_blank"><b>openSUSE</b></a> is a Linux-based free operating system. It is completely dominated by the community. Whether a technology enthusiast, a developer or a business user, you can find your own version here. Besides, you will enjoy the experience of sharing with and learning from the people around the world.</p>
      <p><b>openSUSE.Asia Summit 2014</b> is the first openSUSE Summit in Asia, which aims to promote openSUSE and other free and open source software in the region (especially in colleges). openSUSE.Asia Summit is a non-commercial conference. In the conference, we are going to launch a series of free and open source software lectures, discussions and workshops, so that more Asian users will have a chance to understand the concepts, use the software and join the community. Meanwhile, the summit also provides a free platform for Asian users to communicate with each other face to face. Participants can take this opportunity to learn about the related technologies and share their experiences. The first openSUSE.Asia Summit is scheduled on <b><i>October 18th</i></b> and <b><i>19th, 2014,</i></b> in <b>Beijing</b>. We hope that it will be held in other countries in Asia in the next few years.</p>

      <p><b><u>The Four Tracks</u></b></p>
      <p>This is the first openSUSE Asia Summit. The theme is:</p>
      <p class="text-center xxl"><b>openSUSE - Bring you to the free world!</b></p>
      <ul>
          <li>End User Track
              <p>The end user track provides the opportunity for the power users of any application to share their knowledge and share tricks they apply to get the most out of the applications they use. Know of a non-obvious but very useful feature, present it's usage to fellow Geekos and users in this track. Topics include, but not limited to, applications, desktop environments, multimedia solutions and games.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Business Track
              <p>The business track provides the opportunity for those that use openSUSE and/or FOSS in their business to describe the unique challenges they face. This includes, but not limited to, issues and solutions of interfacing with regulatory institutions, other business, staff training, and changing technology course.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Community & Project Track
              <p>Sessions in this area should focus on project and community activities, including, but not limited to, project governance, marketing, artwork and advocate reports. In many cases, this sessions bring a strong sense of unity to the project as a whole as we discuss some of the unique challenges that an Open Source Community confronts. If you have ideas that can help a community be stronger, join this track.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Technology & Development Track
              <p>Sessions in this area should focus on system technology and distribution development. Including, but not limited to, software packaging, development/testing/debugging tools/practices/methods. Infrastructure software, deployment strategies and monitoring. These sessions will help a few of our members gain understanding of the many tools they can use when working in development for the distribution and other exciting projects.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b><u>The Events</u></b></p>
      <p>We will have four types of events:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Lightning Talk (10 mins)</li>
         <li>Short Talk (30 mins)</li>
         <li>Long Talk (60 mins)</li>
         <li>Workshop (2 hours)</li>
      </ul><br />

      <p>If it is possible that your audience can practise what you share in a meeting room, you would better do a workshop.</p>
