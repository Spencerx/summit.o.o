      <p>openSUSE is a Linux-based free operating system. It is completely dominated by the community. Whether a technology enthusiast, a developer or a business user, you can find your own version here. Besides, you will enjoy the experience of sharing with and learning from the people around the world.</p>
      <p>openSUSE.Asia Summit 2014 is the first openSUSE Summit in Asia, which aims to promote openSUSE and other free and open source software in the region (especially in colleges). openSUSE.Asia Summit is a non-commercial conference. In the conference, we are going to launch a series of free and open source software lectures, discussions and workshops, so that more Asian users will have a chance to understand the concepts, use the software and join the community. Meanwhile, the summit also provides a free platform for Asian users to communicate with each other face to face. Participants can take this opportunity to learn about the related technologies and share their experiences. The first openSUSE.Asia Summit is scheduled on October 18th and 19th, 2014, in Beijing. We hope that it will be held in other countries in Asia in the next few years.</p>
